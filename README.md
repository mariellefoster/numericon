# numericon
Building up a variety of algorithmic tests, subprograms and facts about numbers.

# how to run
type 'python numericon.py' to run main file in the command line. Takes in either integer input, or 'q' to quit out of the loop.

Not great with giant numbers, because my prime factor algorithm is quite slow (ie brute force). This will be eventually remedied.
